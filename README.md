# Google Calendar Chat Agent üóìÔ∏èü§ñ

An AI-based chat agent that interfaces with Google Calendar using Google's Gemini API. Manage your calendar through natural language conversations!

## Features

- ü§ñ **Natural Language Interface**: Chat with your calendar using everyday language
- üîê **Secure Authentication**: OAuth2 authentication for Google Calendar
- üîë **Personal Gemini API**: Use your own Gemini API key for AI-powered interactions
- üìÖ **Calendar Management**: List, create, update, and delete events
- üí¨ **Conversational AI**: Powered by Google's Gemini AI model

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Google Account with Calendar access
- A Gemini API key (get it from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shanujha/google-calendar-chat.git
cd google-calendar-chat
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or create a virtual environment first (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Google Calendar API Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Google Calendar API**:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Calendar API"
   - Click "Enable"
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Choose "Desktop app" as the application type
   - Download the credentials
5. Save the downloaded file as `credentials.json` in the project root directory

### 4. Set Up Gemini API Key

Get your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

You can provide the API key in two ways:

**Option 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

**Option 2: .env File**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Usage

Run the chat agent:

```bash
python calendar_chat.py
```

On first run, you'll be prompted to authenticate with Google Calendar through your browser.

### Example Commands

Once the chat agent is running, try these commands:

- **List Events**: 
  - "Show my upcoming events"
  - "What's on my calendar?"
  - "List my events"

- **General Queries**:
  - "What do I have tomorrow?"
  - "Am I free this afternoon?"
  - "Tell me about my schedule"

- **Create Events** (Basic):
  - "Create an event"
  - "Schedule a meeting"

## Architecture

The application consists of three main components:

1. **CalendarService**: Handles Google Calendar API operations (list, create, update, delete events)
2. **GeminiAgent**: Manages AI interactions using Google's Gemini API for natural language understanding
3. **CalendarChatAgent**: Coordinates between the calendar service and AI agent to process user queries

## Files

- `calendar_chat.py`: Main application file
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `credentials.json`: Google OAuth credentials (you need to create this)
- `token.json`: Stored OAuth tokens (automatically created after first login)
- `.env`: Environment variables (optional, for storing API keys)

## Security Notes

- Never commit `credentials.json`, `token.json`, or `.env` files to version control
- Keep your Gemini API key secure and don't share it publicly
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive files

## Troubleshooting

### "credentials.json not found"
- Make sure you've downloaded the OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
- Save it as `credentials.json` in the project root directory

### "GEMINI_API_KEY not found"
- Set the environment variable or create a `.env` file with your API key
- Get your API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

### Authentication Issues
- Delete `token.json` and try authenticating again
- Make sure you've enabled Google Calendar API in your Google Cloud project
